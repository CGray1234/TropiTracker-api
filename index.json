Environmental conditions are conducive for <br />\n development, and a tropical depression is likely to form within the <br />\n next day or two while the system moves slowly westward into the <br />\n western Caribbean Sea.  Afterward, further development is likely <br />\n while the disturbance meanders over the western Caribbean Sea <br />\n through the weekend.  The system is expected to turn slowly <br />\n northwestward by early next week. Interests across the western and <br />\n northwestern Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress of this <br />\n system.  Regardless of development, heavy rains are expected over <br />\n Jamaica and the Cayman Islands during the next day or so.
